We are given a bar of chocolate composed of m x n squre pieces. One should break the chocolate into single 
squres. Each break of a part of the chocolate is charged a cost expressed by a positive intreger. This cost does 
not depend on the size of the part that is being broken but only depends on the line the break goes along.
Let us denote the costs of breaking along the consecutive vertical lines with x1, x2, ... , xm-1 and along
horizontal lines with y1, y2, ... , yn-1.

Compute the minimal cost of breaking the whole chocolate into single squres.
